# CP  
Competitive Programming  
Most of the classes are my solutions to problems from competitions and practice questions on codechef.  
In all cases, the naming of the file has been done as [Problem Code].java(except of classes with special purpose).  
To view the problem statement, google "codechef [Problem Code]".
